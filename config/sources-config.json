PHASE 3 — Deal lifecycle system (professional)

Every deal gets:

failed


So you always see:

What’s working

What’s stuck

What’s paying

PHASE 4 — Contracts automation (AI helper)

Not full legal AI (yet), but:

AI will:

Fill contract templates

Prepare:

Wholesale agreement

Assignment agreement

Send to e-signature platform later

You approve → send → close.

You were right about sources — but here’s the winning strategy:

Start with:

25 sources per category for:

Real estate

Cars

Trucks

Construction / farm

Luxury watches

Businesses for sale

Wholesale products

Later expand to 50–100.

Locations:

USA: top 100 cities

Canada: top 50 cities

But:

⚠️ Quality sources > random sites

We target:

Facebook Marketplace

Groups

Auctions

Dealer platforms

Wholesalers

Business brokers

PHASE 6 — AI buyer discovery (next level)

AI will also:

Scrape “Looking to buy” posts

Track:

“WTB car”

“Cash buyer”

Add them into buyers table.

That’s where big money comes from.

PHASE 7 — Stripe automation (after core)

AI will:

Check subscription

Lock premium deals

Upgrade buyers

Take finder fees

Handle deposits

TODAY’S WORK ORDER (REALISTIC)

If we focus:
